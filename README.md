## Setup
 
### 1. Get the source code

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Skoli-Code/CEDEJ-Atlas
$ cd CEDEJ-Atlas
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
# OR
$ yarn install
```

### 3. Run the app
   
```sh
$ npm run dev
# OR 
$ yarn dev
```

It will start the development server with [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) â€” Development server<br>

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and see the application running.

### 4. Deploy the app

By default this app is configured to be deployed on GitHub pages. If you want to change this behavior, update package.json
`deploy` scripts to have the appropriated behavior.

```sh
$ npm run deploy
# OR
$ yarn deploy
```


## Main Components

This app tries to follow the [Atomic](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) design principles.

You'll find those main components to be the key elements of the application:

- Atlas
  - CirclesLayer
  - DesertLabelsLayer
  - WaterLabelsLayer
  - WaterLayer
- AtlasLegend
  - TemperaturesLegend
  - AridityLegendNames
- AtlasFilters
  - AridityFilters
  - TemperaturesFilters
  - CircleSizesFilters
  - CircleTypesFilters

## Translation
Currently this app is developed only in french. To translate it in english (the only additional supported language) you'll need to translate multiple elements:
- all locale files located under `/locales/fr`. 
- all content files located under `/content/fr`. 

All translatable files are already in place but they need to be translated.
